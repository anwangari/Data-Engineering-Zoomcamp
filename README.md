# Data-Engineering-Zoomcamp (ongoing)
Welcome to my repo, where I document my journey learning core principles, tools, and techniques crucial for effective data processing and engineering. Explore my hands-on projects and insights, covering:

  - Environment setup with Docker
  - Workflow orchestration using Mage
  - Data Warehousing with BigQuery
  - Analytics Engineering via dbt
  - Batch Processing with Spark
  - Streaming data processing with Kafka

### **Week 1: Docker**
  - Learned how to set up and manage development environments using Docker containers.
  - Explored containerization concepts, Dockerfile creation, and Docker Compose for multi-container applications.
  - Dived into practical exercises and projects focusing on deploying and scaling postgreSQL dtabases and pgadmin within Docker environments.
